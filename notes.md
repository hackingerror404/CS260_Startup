## Important Info

## Startup GitHub Setup

Important Git Commands:
* git add, git commit (-a to track, -m to write a "_" message), git push, git pull
* git fetch - get the latest information about the changes on GitHub without actually changing your local repository.
* to solve a merging crisis, edit the necessary file manually until it's happy.

A GitHub fork provides the ability to create a copy of a GitHub repository. Fork a repo on GitHub, then pull / clone it onto your machine.
