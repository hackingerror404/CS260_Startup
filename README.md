# The Movie Shelf

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch  
Have you ever accidentally rented a movie online when it turns out you already owned it on DVD, or forgot about a digital purchase or two, and now you have five copies of *Inception* floating around your accounts? For anyone who enjoys watching film, keeping track of the ones you own can be tough. With **The Movie Shelf**, users will be able to store the names of everything in their collection - physical and digital - in one convenient location. Each user will have an individual "shelf" to track their collection, and users can view other people's shelves as well!
