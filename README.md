# The Movie Shelf

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch  
Have you ever accidentally rented a movie online when it turns out you already owned it on DVD, or forgot about a digital purchase or two, and now you have five copies of *Inception* floating around your accounts? For anyone who enjoys watching film, keeping track of the ones you own can be tough. With **The Movie Shelf**, users will be able to store the names of everything in their collection - physical and digital - in one convenient location. Each user will have an individual "shelf" to track their collection, and users can view other people's shelves as well!  

### Design
The top window shows the login screen. The middle window shows the home screen, accessible when a user is logged in. The final window shows a user's shelf, which is visible by clicking on the hyperlink notifications that appear on the home screen whenever something has been added / removed from a shelf.

The top window shows the template for a user's personal shelf, which is the same page as any other shelf, but with the addition of the "edit" button near the top right. The bottom windows shows the edit screen for a user's personal shelf.

### Technologies
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways:
- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Four HTML pages: login, home, user shelf, and edit shelf. Hyperlinks on the 'add', 'remove', and 'edit' buttons, as well as on the notification lines of text on the home page.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice, and contrast.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, home notifications display, displaying shelf items and characteristics, and applying edits to shelf content.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving add/removal notifications
  - retrieving shelf items and characteristics
  - submitting shelf items and characteristics
- **DB** - Store users, choices, and votes in database. 
- **Login** - Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't view the home page or users' shelves unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user adds or removes items from their shelves, a notification about this update is broadcasted to all users on the home page.
- **React** - Application ported to use the React web framework.

### HTML Deliverable
For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.
- **HTML pages** - Four HTML pages that represent the ability to log in, view other users' activity, view a "shelf," and edit entries on your shelf.
- **Links** - The login page links automatically to the home page. The home page, shelf, and edit shelf pages all contain links all pages on the site.
- **Text** - Other users' activity, shelf content, and search results are represented by text.
- **Images** - A simple image of a movie shelf is placed on the login screen.
- **Login** - Input box for username and password, and a submit button for "log in" and "sign up."
- **Database** - The search results on edit-shelf.html represent generated search data from The Movie Database (TMDB).
- **WebSocket** - Other users' activity on the home page represents realtime additions and removals from other users' shelves.
