For anyone who enjoys watching film, keeping track of the ones you own can be tough. With **The Movie Shelf**, users will be able to store the names of everything in their collection - physical and digital - in one convenient location. Each user will have an individual \"shelf\" to track their collection, and users can view other people's shelves as well!",
